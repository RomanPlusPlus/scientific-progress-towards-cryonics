# Cryonics Research Notebooks Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Cryonics Research Notebooks Repository**, a collection of curated resources designed to support the scientific and philosophical exploration of cryonics. Each notebook contains **50 carefully selected documents** related to cryonics, compiled to assist researchers, enthusiasts, and professionals in advancing their understanding of the field.

We invite the cryonics community to collaborate by contributing open-source resource lists. If you have valuable materials to share, please get in touch with the authors to expand this repository and further enrich cryonics research.
